## About the project
__Home__ - is an all-in-one social service that will cover all
aspects of your communication with your home and neighbors.
- Internal notification and news system


- Private messages, chat with selected residents and general OSBB
  group with all residents or OSBB's modules separately


- Residents independently form a budget, determine
  contributions for the maintenance of the house,
  the sequence of solving problems. This makes it possible
  to quickly respond to emergencies, to decide what needs to be
  done in the house or on the adjacent territory in the first place,
  to ensure the protection of the personal and common property of residents


- The ability to choose a service provider such as
  (water, electricity, gas), and pay utility bills


- The best offers and wishes can be implemented in the OSBB
  by residents through internal voting system


- Transparency of expense. The residents' funds go exclusively to the needs
  of their home and are spent rationally. The head of the OSBB reports
  directly to the residents, so they are always aware of what the funds were spent on
